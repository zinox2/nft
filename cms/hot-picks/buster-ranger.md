ONE DAY FOOLIEN, THE BOSS OF THE ALIENS, IS WATCHING THE EARTH TV CHANNELS AND SEES A BIG AND FANTASTIC WATERPARK IN ONE OF THE PROGRAMS. HE SEES THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING FUN THERE AND WISHES TO HAVE ONE TOO. BUT THERE IS NO WATER ON HIS PLANET TO MAKE HIS DREAM COME TRUE. HE DECIDES TO TAKE WATER FOR HIS WATERPARK FROM THE EARTH. SO THEY GET READY AND THEN ATTACK THE EARTH. BUT THE ASTRONAUT HEROES FROM THE EARTH UNITE TO GO TO THE ALIENS’ PLANET TO TAKE THE WATER BACK AND SAVE OUR WORLD.
